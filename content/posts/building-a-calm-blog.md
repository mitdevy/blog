A good blog does not need to shout. It needs to **invite**. I like to start with a soft background, a confident headline, and enough air between lines to slow the reader down.

## What makes it feel calm

- A single display font for emphasis.
- A body font with a friendly rhythm.
- A palette that leans warm, not neon.
- Plenty of margin for the eyes.

> Calm design is not empty design. It is *intentional* design.

### A small checklist

1. Read the page on a small screen.
2. Ensure links are obvious.
3. Keep the header short and helpful.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Design is the pause between words.");
}
```

That is the whole idea behind this little space.
