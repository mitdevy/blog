The best tools do one thing and do it well. This week I shipped a handful of tiny helpers and learned more from them than from any grand project.

## Why small wins matter

Small tools remove friction. They turn a mental chore into a single click or a short command.

### My current defaults

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Ship before the polish loop.
- Keep a text file of ideas.

That is the rhythm I am chasing.
