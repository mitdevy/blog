I keep a small stack for side projects. It is boring on purpose.

## My calm stack

- Next.js for structure.
- Tailwind for quick layout decisions.
- Markdown for writing.

### What I avoid

Over-optimization and novelty for its own sake. If the stack fades into the background, it is doing its job.
